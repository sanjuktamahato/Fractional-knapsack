# Fractional-knapsack
The Fractional Knapsack problem is a greedy algorithm optimization problem where items can be broken into smaller parts. The goal is to maximize total value in a knapsack with limited capacity by taking fractions of items with the highest value-to-weight ratio. It's efficient and solvable in O(n log n) time.
